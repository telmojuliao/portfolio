## Who am I?

I’m a digital Product Designer based in beautiful and sunny Lisbon, Portugal.

My focus is on **designing unique digital experiences** from end-to-end, delivering easy to use products that solve problems and help people’s lives. I apply a **user-centric process** with a keen eye for detail, building empathy with the user while keeping a business oriented perspective.

I’m currently finishing my Digital Experience Design postgraduate course at FBAUL, while consolidating knowledge in UX & UI Design.

Formerly graduated in Graphic Design, allowing me to develop my skills in color, typography and branding. I’m also a tech enthusiast with an eager interest in coding and front-end development (html/css).
