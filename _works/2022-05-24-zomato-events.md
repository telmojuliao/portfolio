Choosing a restaurant for an event can be a nightmare. All guests have different tastes and preferences.

How can we make the host's journey stress-free while considering everyone's preferences?

## Design process

## Context analysis
We started by looking at the Zomato app to deeply understand how it works and manages the featured content. The only reference found to Groups was a list of restaurants that fit best this type of events.

## Benchmark
We checked similar apps like The Fork and apps that feature forms like AirBnB. These flows work with a step-by-step process allowing the user to focus on the content with no distractions.

## Information Architecture
