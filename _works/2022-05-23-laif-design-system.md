The purpose of this project was to select a physical product and design an online shop for it (desktop).

The main challenge was to build a Design System that should meet several constraints, limiting the choices for colors, typography and also components.

## The design process

## Product research
For this project I wanted to work in a product that in a way matches some of my values: **feminism and climate change**.

From informal research I found out that unequal access to menstrual products have significant impacts in women’s lives such as losing days of school and work, it’s a global social justice issue.

Also, as climate change worsens, new products should contribute to a more sustainable planet by being reusable and reducing the astonishing amount of products that end up in landfills or in the oceans.

## The product
The chosen product was the Menstrual Cup. A small cup made of rubber or silicone that’s inserted into the vagina to collect period fluid.

Cups can hold more blood than other methods, leading many women to use them as an eco-friendly alternative to tampons. It’s also easy to distribute being an interesting option to fight social inequality.
