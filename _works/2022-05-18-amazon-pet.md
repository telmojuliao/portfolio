Despite having several sales segments, the Amazon marketplace doesn't have a tailored experience for the purchase of pet supplies.

We were challenged to adopt a new strategy to improve the user experience in the PEt Supplies department, making the website simpler, intuitive and accessible through customization that responds more easily to the purchase process.

## Competitor analysis
We explored 16 pet related online shops and in the analysis we concluded that:
* Clear information structure and hierarchy, helps the process of searching and buying products
* Excessive content and lack of personalization makes it difficult to find the right product for your pet
* Progressive filters help to narrow your search
