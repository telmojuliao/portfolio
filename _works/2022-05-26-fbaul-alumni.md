University websites can sometimes be overwhelming due to the amount of content and different users they need to address.

For this postgraduate course project, we were asked to rethink and redesign the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon website, but with a specific target in mind: **alumni**.

## The design process
To better align the team towards a common goal we used the Double Diamond process which led to better communication and efficient iterative phases.

## Primary research
We conducted a **quick survey** to get information on how former students use (or not) the website of their former institutions.

From that survey we talked to a few people in informal **interviews** to get a more in-depth notion of their activities and needs. **Most users visit the website looking for information on courses.**

**What they look for in the website as former students:**
* information on courses
* news and events
* information on documents 

**What they see as benefits:**
* networking 
* mentoring from older former students
* job opportunities
* inspiration and professional update
